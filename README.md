- `books_library_eurobarometer_79_2.csv`

## Data  

The folder `data` contains all the data for the analysis. In this folder, the `all_data_for_analysis.rda` contains several versions of our data:

- `geodata`: the download count data aggregated over the boundaries of the NUTS2 regions (following the NUTS2016 definition)
- `eurostat_data`: contains all Eurostat variables from `bookpiracy_2020-04-15.rda`  and the count data from `geodata` 
- `eurostat_complete_data`: the filteres version of the `eurostat_data`, only regions where all variables are available `eurostat_complete_data`
- `eurostat_complete_scaled`: the scaled version of the 
- `eurostat_eurobarometer_data`: all Eurostat variables and variables created from Eurobarometer
- `eurostat_eurobarometer_complete_data`: the previous data set filtered for the regions where all data is available - this dataset is smaller than the one with Eurostat-only variables
- `eurostat_eurobarometer_scaled`: the scaled version of the `eurostat_eurobarometer_complete_data`
- `dataset_source_statistics` is an overview of the variables.
